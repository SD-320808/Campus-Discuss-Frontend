## This directory is for React components for the screens there in the app.

For example, if you want to make the React component for the personal stream, you will create a folder here (named, say 'personal-stream' or whatever). The folder will have an `index.js` file for the React component, and a `style.css` file for any CSS needed (same as components folder, basically).

Ask me if you have any doubts or issues :)
