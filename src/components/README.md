## This directory is for individual React components that we'll use in our app.

For example, if you want to make the React component for displaying a minimized post, you will create a folder here (named, say 'post-short' or whatever). The folder will have an `index.js` file for the React component, and a `style.css` file for any CSS needed.

Ask me if you have any doubts or issues :)
